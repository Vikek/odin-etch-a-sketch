# Odin Project Etch-A-Sketch

## A simple sketching app where you can setup a grid of divs and color them to your liking
The purpose of this project was to test my javascript skills in manipulating the DOM tree.

## How to use
Clicking the add boxes button prompts the user for the amount of boxes in the grid(capped at 100x100) and the color picker lets the user change color. moving your mouse over the grid after adding boxes changes the color of them.
